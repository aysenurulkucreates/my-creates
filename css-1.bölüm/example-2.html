            <p>Pilates (/pɪˈlɑːtiːz/;[1][2] German: [piˈlaːtəs]) is a type of mind-body exercise developed in the early 20th century by German physical trainer Joseph Pilates, after whom it was named. Pilates called his method "Contrology".[3] Pilates uses a combination of around 50 repetitive exercises to spur muscle exertion. Each exercise flows from the "five essentials": breath, cervical alignment, rib and scapular stabilization, pelvic mobility, and utilization of the transversus abdominis. Each exercise is typically repeated three to five times.[4] As of 2023, over 12 million people practice Pilates.[5]</p>

           <p>Pilates developed in the aftermath of the late nineteenth century physical culture of exercising to alleviate ill health. There is, however, only limited evidence to support the use of Pilates to alleviate problems such as lower back pain.[6] While studies have found that regular sessions improve balance, and can help muscle conditioning in healthy adults (compared to doing no exercise), it has not been shown to be an effective treatment for any medical condition.[7][8]</p>

            <p>Pilates was developed by Joseph Pilates from Mönchengladbach, Germany. His father was a gymnast and his mother a naturopath.</p>

           <p>Pilates said that the inspiration for his method came to him during World War I, while he was being held at Knockaloe Internment Camp in the Isle of Man.[9] Pilates spent four years there, working on his fellow internees,[9] developing his method of a system of exercises intended to strengthen the human mind and body, believing that mental and physical health were interrelated.[10]</p>

          <p>In his youth, Pilates had practiced many of the physical training regimens available in Germany, and it was from these that he developed his own method. It has clear connections with the physical culture of the late nineteenth century, such as the use of special apparatuses, and claims that the exercises could cure ill health. It is also related to the tradition of "corrective exercise" or "medical gymnastics" as typified by Pehr Henrik Ling.

            Pilates accompanied his method with a variety of equipment, which he called "apparatus". Each apparatus was designed to help accelerate the process of stretching, strengthening, body alignment and increased core strength started by mat work. This included the Reformer, originally called the Universal Reformer, named for "universally reforming the body". Eventually Pilates designed other apparatus, including the Cadillac, Wunda Chair, High "Electric" Chair, Spine Corrector, Ladder Barrel and Pedi-Pole.[10]</p>

        <p>He published two books related to his training method: Your Health: A Corrective System of Exercising That Revolutionizes the Entire Field of Physical Education (1934) and Return to Life Through Contrology (1945).</p>

       <p>During his lifetime, Joseph Pilates directly trained and certified only two assistants, Kathy Stanford Grant and Lolita San Miguel.[11][12][13]</p>
